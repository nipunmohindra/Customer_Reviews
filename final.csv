21,3,Just okay,"Product looks great and once installed doesn't move or squeak. Problem is with the joints & edges.1. Joints - The way joints are connected is not very sturdy & will loosen up over time. Especially towards the leg side, it's not a very strong joint & got loosened up. 2. Edges - Very sharp edges & one would get hurt unless careful, especially kids. So, we use the bedsheets in a different way, we don't shove the ends under the mattress. We spread it over the edges. And, this is after my daugh...READ MORE"
