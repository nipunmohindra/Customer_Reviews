# Customer_Reviews
Propositon of a novel and effective web mining technique for assessing the customer review for a particular product based on cluster techniques. 
As e-commerce is gaining popularity day by day, the
web has become an excellent source for gathering customer
reviews / opinions by the market researchers. The number of
customer reviews that a product receives is growing at very fast
rate (It could be in hundreds or thousands). Customer reviews
posted on the websites vary greatly in quality. The potential
customer has to read necessarily all the reviews irrespective of
their quality to make a decision on whether to purchase the
product or not. In this paper, we make an attempt to assess a
review based on its quality, to help the customer make a proper
buying decision. The quality of customer review is assessed as
most significant, more significant, significant and insignificant.
A novel and effective web mining technique is proposed for
assessing a customer review of a particular product based on the
feature clustering techniques, namely, k-means method and
fuzzy c-means method. This is performed in three steps : (1)
Identify review regions and extract reviews from it, (2) Extract
and cluster the features of reviews by a clustering technique and
then assign weights to the features belonging to each of the
clusters (groups) and (3) Assess the review by considering the
feature weights and group belongingness. The k-means and
fuzzy c-means clustering techniques are implemented and tested
on customer reviews extracted from web pages. Performance of
these techniques are analyzed.
